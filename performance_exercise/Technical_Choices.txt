- Class AnagramsFinder
- Method 'displayAnagrams' is static, because it doesn't require the use of any non static variables.
Static also, so it can be used without having to instatiate the class (less work).
- To read the file , I use 'Scanner' because we are interested in reading word by word.
- Use of a method which sort words alphabeticaly. sorted words are used as keys in the map.
- The PathFile is passed to the main method as an argument so we can re-use the program for other files.
- By using Scanner, we are reducing the use of the memory, we keep just the current word, but this program is using a HashMap which hold all the words of the file, so in a context where we are reading very big files, we can have an out of memory error.
